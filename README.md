# CP_TA
Framework for making text adventure-esque problems for competitive programming.

Run make to compile main, then run bin/main.

Biggest thing that's not implemented is solution-checker communication, in such a way that
this communication can be captured (to display to solvers, e.g. last 100 lines...)
